# Index Performance: Properties & Reviews Query

We tested the performance impact of adding an index on the `reviews.property_id` column.  
The query under test was:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM properties 
JOIN reviews 
  ON properties.property_id = reviews.property_id 
WHERE properties.property_id IN (
  SELECT property_id 
  FROM reviews 
  GROUP BY property_id 
  HAVING AVG(rating) > 4.0
);
```

## 1. Without Index

EXPLAIN

        -> Select #2 (subquery in condition; run only once)

```
ðŸ‘‰ Here, reviews was relying on a foreign key (fk_review_property), but performance was limited because property_id in reviews had no dedicated index.
This led to table scans inside the subquery.

## 2. Adding Index

We added a covering index on reviews.property_id:
```
CREATE INDEX reviews_property_idx ON reviews(property_id);
```

No index was needed on properties.property_id because it is already the primary key.

## 3. With Index

## 4. Performance Comparison

Before Index:

Subquery relied on scanning reviews table using only FK metadata.

Actual execution time: 0.429..0.493 ms

After Index:

reviews_property_idx was used in both main join and subquery.

Actual execution time dropped: 0.243..0.292 ms
